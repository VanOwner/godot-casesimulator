## Forked from @mberkdemir haven't started work on it yet. <br/>

## Godot Engine Case Simulator Description <br/>
Project includes fundamental of case opening systems. You can start to develop more complex case opening systems by using this repo.
<br/>

## Planned Developments <br/>
1) Different items for different cases will be added.
2) Rarity will be added. There is no rarity for the items right now but will be added.
3) Sound effects will be added.
4) Saving the items you have earned and listing will be added.

## A Note <br/>
If you use different size for the case items and different spacing the final result could be wrong. You should calculate high limit and increasing value again.
